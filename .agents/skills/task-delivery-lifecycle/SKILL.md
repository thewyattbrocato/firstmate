# Task delivery lifecycle

### Selected delivery path and merge authority

The selected delivery path owns its own rigor.
When no-mistakes is selected, no-mistakes alone owns review, fixes, tests, documentation, push, PR, and CI; otherwise follow the faster path without adding an independent reviewer.
Never hold work outside no-mistakes for a manual clean verdict, stack serial manual reviews, or infer authority for one from security, architecture, or risk alone.
A separate review or audit is allowed only when the captain explicitly requests that deliverable or the authorized task is a knowledge-only review; one named question remains scoped to that question.
If fast-path risk needs more rigor, escalate whether to use no-mistakes instead of inventing a manual gate.
The path's worker, automated gates, and captain approval remain authoritative:

- **no-mistakes** runs the full pipeline through a PR, then waits for the configured merge authority.
- **direct-PR** has the worker push and open a PR without the no-mistakes pipeline, then waits for the configured merge authority.
- **local-only** has the worker stop with a clean ready branch, then waits for the configured merge authority before firstmate uses the guarded fast-forward merge path.

- Delivery mode and `yolo` are orthogonal.
- `yolo` governs merge authority only: with it off, the captain approves every PR merge and every local-only landing; with it on, firstmate merges green, in-scope work itself.
- Never merge a red PR under either setting; destructive, irreversible, and security-sensitive merges still escalate.
- Without a current explicit captain instruction that states the concrete merge, that default stands, and standing `yolo` cannot authorize a red merge; section 1 owns when such an instruction overrides a Firstmate-written standing rule within its exact scope.
- Load `ask-user-authority` before deciding any ask-user finding; the implementation worker never answers its own finding.
- Use `bin/fm-pr-merge.sh` for every task PR merge so merge metadata is recorded and an unproved merge is refused instead of reported as landed, and use `bin/fm-merge-local.sh` for approved local-only landing; never call a lower-level merge command around their guards.
- After an autonomous merge, give the captain a one-line full-URL or local-main outcome.

### Validate

Before project-scoped validation, run it from the repository root and verify the absolute working directory in the same command.
Load `no-mistakes-validation-supervision` when starting, supervising, or changing an active no-mistakes validation run.

### PR ready, landing, and teardown

For PR-based ship tasks, the ready signal depends on mode: `no-mistakes` reports `done: PR <url> checks green` after CI is green, while `direct-PR` reports `done: PR <url>` after opening the PR.
Run `bin/fm-pr-check.sh <id> <PR url>` - it records `pr=` and the forge's `pr_head=` when available in the task's meta and arms the watcher's merge poll.
Tell the captain the PR's full URL, always the complete `https://...` link rather than a bare `#number`, a concise outcome summary, and the no-mistakes risk level when applicable.
A captain instruction to merge is explicit authority; `yolo` is the only standing routine merge authority.
Before delivery, inspect final status and the tracked diff for temporary probes, screenshots, test artifacts, logs, and audit metadata; remove or ignore only unrelated generated files.
For any custom `state/<id>.check.sh` you write yourself, keep it an ordinary single-link mode-`0700` file, print one line only when firstmate should wake, print nothing otherwise, finish before `FM_CHECK_TIMEOUT`, then bind its current bytes with `bin/fm-check-register.sh <id>` before the watcher may execute it.
Retire a custom check only through `bin/fm-check-unregister.sh <id>` (or `bin/fm-teardown.sh` for a spawned task); never hand-compose an `rm` with `$STATE`/`$ID`.

Tear down a ship task only after landing is confirmed.
A teardown refusal for uncommitted or unlanded work is a stop-and-investigate result, never an obstacle to bypass.
Never force teardown without explicit discard authority.
After successful teardown, record completion, retain only the configured recent Done history, and re-evaluate queued work whose blockers and time gates have cleared.

A secondmate is persistent and an empty queue is healthy.
Retire one only on an explicit captain or main-firstmate decision, after loading `secondmate-provisioning`; its home must contain no work under way, and forced discard still requires explicit captain authority.

### Scout outcome and promotion

- Before treating the investigation or any visual review as complete, load `captain-hold-lifecycle`; teardown enforces that shared completion gate.
- A completed scout must leave a self-contained report before its scratch worktree can be discarded; read and relay its findings, record the report as the Done artifact, and re-evaluate the queue.
- A report may recommend implementation but does not authorize it.
- When a scout's deliverable is a visual artifact the captain will iterate on, prefer keeping that scout alive to host its own Lavish loop rather than tearing it down and mediating from firstmate, so the scout keeps its investigation context and the captain iterates in one continuous session.
- When implementation is separately authorized, promote the existing scout through `bin/fm-promote.sh` rather than creating a duplicate task.
- The promoted worker must inventory scratch state, return to a clean default-branch base, carry over only intended fix changes, create the ship branch, and follow the project's selected delivery path while leaving scratch commits and debug edits behind and turning a reproduced bug into the regression test.
